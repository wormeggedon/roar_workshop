# Introduction

The Old Faithful data set contains the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Tellowstone National Parkm Wyoming, USA.

```{r, load dataframe} df <- faithful ```


The data description is fiven in the table below. 

|Variable        |Description                            | 
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
|eruptions       |  the duration of the eruption, minutes|
|waiting	       | waiting time to next eruption, minutes|

A summary of the distributions of each variable are as follows

``` {r summary} 
    summary(df)
```

The marginal distributions of the variable shown below:

``` {r} hist(df$eruptions)```

``` {r} hist(df$waiting)```

# Conclusions and Further Work

Both the duration of eruptions and waiting time show a bimodal distribution. In further work I will plot the scatter of the data (‘eruptions duration’ vs ‘waiting time’ ) to see whether I can detect any patterns

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
